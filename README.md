# Bodyshape

BodyShape is a modern and responsive fitness website landing page design, created using Figma. The design focuses on delivering a high-impact, visually engaging experience for users looking to transform their body and join a professional gym or fitness center.

## Technologies used:
    1. Html
    2. Tailwind CSS
    3. FontAwesome
    4. AOS (for animation) etc.

## The challenge I faced:
### Responsive Design Handling (Tailwind Breakpoints):
  * Adjusting the layout correctly for different screen sizes was quite time-consuming.
  * It took time to learn to understand and use the sm, md, lg, xl breakpoints of Tailwind CSS.

### Navigation Menu Toggle on Mobile:
  * To toggle the responsive navbar, I had to learn how to implement menu hide/show using Tailwind class and JavaScript.
  * Had to face mobile menu scrollbar and overlay issue.
